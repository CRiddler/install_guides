# UC Davis DataLab Install Guides

## Contributing

To update an install guide page, first fork this repository and make changes to your fork. You can knit this page to check your changes.

When you link to an external page in a toolkit, please add `{rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}` after the link, e.g. `[Link text](https://link.address.com){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}`. This will make it so the links open in a new window, rather than in the toolkit iframe on the DataLab website.

If you would like to create a new guide, please contact the DataLab to make sure we do not have something similar under development.

Regardless of how you contribute, make sure to add your name to the contributors list on the index page!
